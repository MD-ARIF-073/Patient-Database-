Patient database management system using client server model

Patient management is the set of activities that healthcare practices use to manage and deliver on patients' rising expectations. It's an approach that focuses on fostering strong patient relationships instead of just treating illnesses.A clinical management plan forms the foundation of a patient's treatment after her initial admission and treatment by a healthcare provider, and must be based on the patient's medical condition or conditions and treatment preferences, as well as recommendations by physicians, nurses, or other healthcare professionals.
